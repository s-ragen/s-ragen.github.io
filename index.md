Hi! I'm Zho :) 

<img src="/assets/photo.png" width="200" height="200" />

I am a recent doctoral graduate in climate dynamics with a PhD in physical oceanography from the UW School of Oceanography, where I work with Professor Kyle Armour. My research focus is the role of the general ocean circulation in climate. I use idealized climate models to study the fundamental drivers of ocean circulation and the impact of increasing greenhouse gases on ocean and atmospheric circulation. If you're interested, take a look at my [Publications](/publications.md) to see papers about the projects I've worked on. 

While at UW, I have been an active member of the [Program on Climate Change](https://pcc.uw.edu/), serving on the Board and on the Graduate Steering Committee. I helped organize several [Climate Science on Tap](http://cascadiaclimateaction.org/on-tap/) events with Cascadia Climate Action and other Program on Climate Change graduate students. I also co-chaired the organizing committee of the 2020 [Graduate Climate Conference](http://graduateclimateconference.com/).   

One of my passions is providing accessible, accurate education around climate and climate change. My capstone project for the Program on Climate Change involved the creation of a short course on the physics of the climate system titled "Physics of a Changing Climate: Energy Conservation and Transfer." This course is available to the public on the [Open Educational Resources Commons](https://oercommons.org/courses/physics-of-a-changing-climate-energy-conservation-and-transfer). 

Before starting graduate school, I spent some time through-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. I moved to Oakland for a while and worked at a pet store attached to a veterinary clinic selling prescription dog and cat food. 

I graduated from Johns Hopkins with Bachelor's degrees in Earth & Planetary Science and Global Environmental Change & Sustainability. As an undergrad, I fell in love with the Coriolis force thanks to Professors Anand Gnanadesikan and Thomas Haine.  

I grew up in Seattle, WA though I travelled to visit family in China almost every summer. 

In my free time, you are likely to find me organizing against imperialism for a just and lasting peace. This is how I am fighting for climate justice and liberation from oppression.
