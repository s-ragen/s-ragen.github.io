The focus of my PhD was developing a numerical coupled general circulation model to test the importance of ocean basin geometry on ocean circulation and climate. In other words, with the help of some brilliant people, I modified a computer program that models the physics of the ocean and sea-ice, made some custom coastline shapes, and tacked it onto another computer program that models the physics of the atmosphere and the land. We made different continents to try to better understand how certain features - like the narrow width of the Atlantic compared to the Pacific, the curve of the Eastern North American seaboard, the horn of Africa - change the way the ocean moves water, heat, salt, and other nutrients around the world. We learned that widening the Atlantic ocean can result in a stronger circulation in an ocean-only model. However, when we added in a dynamic atmosphere, the model placed deep water formation in the North Pacific Ocean, when in the real world, these physics occur in the North Atlantic. Then, when we moved the northern boundary of the Pacific Ocean farther south, the deep sinking switched over to the Atlantic. We also explored ways in which heat is more effectively transported by the ocean when there are continents that extend farther towards the poles compared to when there are no continents or when they are more concentrated in the low latitudes. Additionally, we see that the heat transport in the atmosphere is almost all accomplished by evaporation and subsequent condensation of water.
