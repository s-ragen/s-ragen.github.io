I am a physical oceanogrpahy graduate student in the UW School of Oceanography working with Kyle Armour. My research focus is the role of the general ocean circulation in climate. I use idealized climate models to study the fundamental drivers of ocean circulation and the impact of increasing greenhouse gases on ocean and atmospheric circulation.
